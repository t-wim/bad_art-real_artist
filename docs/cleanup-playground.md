# Playground feature cleanup

## Removed or adjusted artifacts
- Deleted `src/app/playground/page.tsx` including the embedded API route exports for `/api/playground`.

## Remaining stubs or fallbacks
- None. The playground feature had no downstream dependencies, so full removal was safe.

## Notes for re-enabling
1. Reintroduce a client page under `src/app/playground/page.tsx` (or another route) if the chat UI should return.
2. Recreate the proxy handler under `src/app/api/playground/route.ts` to forward chat requests to the backend service.
3. Restore any navigation entry or CTA pointing to the playground once the route exists again.

## Verification
- Searched the repository to confirm no active imports or routes still reference the playground feature.
